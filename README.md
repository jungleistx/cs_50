# cs_50

These exercises are done for the Harvard's course CS50. </br>

I used my own libft-library, which contains previously done functions like ft_printf. </br>
My libft is found here: </br>

so some of my implementations might be different from the originals. </br>
Output of the program(s) should be matching.
