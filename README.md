# cs_50

These exercises are done for the Harvard's course CS50. </br>

https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/

I used my own libft-library, which contains previously done functions like ft_printf. </br>
My libft is found here: </br>

NOTE: I didnt have access to the starting materials or the cs50-library, </br>
so some of my implementations might be different from the originals. </br>
Output of the program(s) should be matching.
