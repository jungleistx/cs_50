Encoding a Message
Light bulbs can only be on or off. In other words, light bulbs represent two possible states; either the bulb is on, or the bulb is off, just as binary numbers are either 1 or 0. We’ll have to find a way to encode text as a sequence of binary numbers.

Let’s write a program called bulbs that takes a message and converts it to a set of bulbs that we could show to an unsuspecting audience. We’ll do it in two steps:

The first step consists of turning the text into decimal numbers. Let’s say we want to encode the message HI!. Luckily, we already have a convention in place for how to do this, ASCII. Notice that H is represented by the decimal number 72, I is represented by 73, and ! is represented by 33.
The next step involves taking our decimal numbers (like 72, 73, and 33) and converting them into equivalent binary numbers, which only use 0s and 1s. For the sake of having a consistent number of bits in each of our binary numbers, assume that each decimal is represented with 8 bits. 72 is 01001000, 73 is 01001001, and 33 is 00100001.
Lastly, we’ll interpret these binary numbers as instructions for the light bulbs on stage; 0 is off, 1 is on. (You’ll find that bulbs.c includes a print_bulb function that’s been implemented for you, which takes in a 0 or 1 and outputs emoji representing light bulbs.)

Here’s an example of how the completed program might work. Unlike the Sanders stage, we’ll print one byte per line for clarity.

# ./bulbs
Message: HI!
⚫🟡⚫⚫🟡⚫⚫⚫
⚫🟡⚫⚫🟡⚫⚫🟡
⚫⚫🟡⚫⚫⚫⚫🟡
To check our work, we can read a bulb that’s on (🟡) as a 1 and bulb that’s off (⚫) as a 0. Then HI! became

01001000
01001001
00100001
which is precisely what we’d expect.

Another example:

# ./bulbs
Message: HI MOM
⚫🟡⚫⚫🟡⚫⚫⚫
⚫🟡⚫⚫🟡⚫⚫🟡
⚫⚫🟡⚫⚫⚫⚫⚫
⚫🟡⚫⚫🟡🟡⚫🟡
⚫🟡⚫⚫🟡🟡🟡🟡
⚫🟡⚫⚫🟡🟡⚫🟡
Notice that all characters are included in the lightbulb instructions, including nonalphabetical characters like spaces (00100000).

Specification
Design and implement a program, bulbs, that converts text into instructions for the strip of bulbs on CS50’s stage as follows:

Implement your program in a file called bulbs.c.
Your program must first ask the user for a message using get_string.
Your program must then convert the given string into a series of 8-bit binary numbers, one for each character of the string.
You can use the provided print_bulb function to print a series of 0s and 1s as a series of yellow and black emoji, which represent on and off light bulbs.
Each “byte” of 8 symbols should be printed on its own line when outputted; there should be a \n after the last “byte” of 8 symbols as well.
