Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

After 1000 simulations, the results seems to be consistent. Even with 10000 simulations, the program runs in under tenth of a second.
10000 is a good middle-ground for speed and accuracy.
